# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

**Project 1**: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns - Neural Networks

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

**Project 2**: Landmark Classification and Tagging for Social Media - Convolutional Neural Networks

**Project 3**: Generate TV Scripts - Reccurent Neural Networks

**Project 4**: Generate Faces - Generative Adversarial Networks

**Project 5**: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model - Deploying a Model
