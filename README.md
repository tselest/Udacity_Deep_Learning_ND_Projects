**Project 1**: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns - Neural Networks

![bike-share-data-science-hero](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47558926/123308703-a943c400-d52c-11eb-8e64-7a74ae2f16fe.png)

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

**Project 2**: Landmark Classification and Tagging for Social Media - Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module to build a landmark classifier. You will go through the machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and using your own images to heuristically evaluate your best CNN.

**Project 3**: Generate TV Scripts - Reccurent Neural Networks

**Project 4**: Generate Faces - Generative Adversarial Networks

**Project 5**: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model - Deploying a Model
